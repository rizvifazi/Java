Let's dive into the topic of **Lambda Operations & Streams in Java** by answering some common questions:

### 1. **What are Lambda Expressions in Java?**
   Lambda expressions in Java are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows you to write concise code. They are essentially a way to create anonymous methods (i.e., methods without a name) on-the-fly. Lambda expressions are particularly useful for writing short snippets of code that can be passed as arguments to methods that expect functional interfaces.

   **Syntax:**
   ```java
   (parameters) -> expression
   ```
   Example:
   ```java
   (int x, int y) -> x + y
   ```

### 2. **What is a Stream in Java?**
   A Stream in Java is a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. Streams are not data structures but abstractions for processing sequences of elements, such as arrays or collections. They provide a high-level way to operate on data by offering a clear and concise API to perform complex data manipulations.

   **Key Characteristics:**
   - **Laziness:** Operations on streams are lazy, meaning intermediate operations are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
   - **Pipelining:** Stream operations can be chained together in a pipeline.
   - **Automatic Iteration:** Streams automatically iterate through elements, unlike iterators which require explicit iteration.

### 3. **How do Lambda Expressions and Streams work together?**
   Lambda expressions are often used with streams to provide a functional approach to processing collections. For example, lambda expressions can be used to specify the behavior of operations such as `filter`, `map`, and `forEach` in streams.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.stream()
        .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
        .forEach(System.out::println);
   ```
   In this example, a lambda expression is used in the `filter` operation to keep only the names that start with "A".

### 4. **What are the common operations provided by Streams?**
   Some of the most common operations provided by streams include:
   - **`filter`:** Filters elements based on a predicate (a boolean-valued function).
   - **`map`:** Transforms each element using a given function.
   - **`forEach`:** Performs an action for each element of the stream.
   - **`collect`:** Converts the stream into a different form, typically a collection.
   - **`reduce`:** Reduces the elements of the stream to a single value using a binary operator.
   - **`sorted`:** Sorts the elements of the stream.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   int sum = numbers.stream()
                    .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                    .mapToInt(n -> n * n)
                    .sum();
   System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 20
   ```

### 5. **What is the difference between `map` and `flatMap` in Streams?**
   - **`map`:** Transforms each element of the stream using a function, but the function returns a single value (or object) for each input.
   - **`flatMap`:** Transforms each element of the stream using a function that returns a stream for each input, and then flattens the resulting streams into a single stream.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<List<String>> namesNested = Arrays.asList(
       Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob"),
       Arrays.asList("Charlie", "David")
   );

   List<String> namesFlatMap = namesNested.stream()
                                          .flatMap(List::stream)
                                          .collect(Collectors.toList());

   System.out.println(namesFlatMap);  // Output: [Alice, Bob, Charlie, David]
   ```

### 6. **What are Parallel Streams?**
   Parallel streams in Java allow you to perform stream operations in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors. When you invoke the `parallelStream()` method on a collection, Java divides the stream into multiple substreams and processes them in parallel.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
                    .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
   System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 15
   ```

### 7. **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Lambda Expressions and Streams?**
   **Advantages:**
   - **Conciseness:** Lambda expressions reduce the amount of boilerplate code.
   - **Functional Programming:** Streams and lambda expressions promote a functional programming style, which can be more intuitive and easier to reason about.
   - **Parallel Processing:** Streams make it easy to parallelize operations, which can improve performance on multi-core systems.

   **Disadvantages:**
   - **Readability:** Code using lambda expressions and streams can sometimes be harder to read and understand, especially for developers unfamiliar with functional programming.
   - **Debugging:** Debugging stream operations can be more challenging than debugging traditional for-loops.
   - **Overhead:** In some cases, streams can introduce overhead, particularly when used improperly or when the operations performed are not suitable for parallel processing.

The correct options that best answer the question about interfaces provided in the `java.util.function` package are:

1. **Predicate**
2. **Consumer**

**Explanation:**

- **Predicate:** This is a functional interface that represents a function that takes an argument and returns a boolean value. It is often used for filtering.
    
- **Consumer:** This is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result (i.e., it "consumes" the input).
    

The other two options:

- **Method** is not an interface; it's a concept in programming related to a function or procedure associated with an object or class.
- **Producer** is not a standard interface in the `java.util.function` package. The corresponding interface for producing values would be `Supplier`.

So, the best answers are **Predicate** and **Consumer**.

The correct options that best answer the question about the different types of methods available in the `Optional` class are:

1. **Static method**
2. **Concrete method**

**Explanation:**

- **Static method:** The `Optional` class provides several static methods, such as `Optional.of()`, `Optional.empty()`, and `Optional.ofNullable()`, which are used to create `Optional` instances.
    
- **Concrete method:** The `Optional` class also provides several concrete (instance) methods that can be called on `Optional` objects, such as `get()`, `isPresent()`, `ifPresent()`, `orElse()`, etc.
    

The other options:

- **Abstract method:** There are no abstract methods in the `Optional` class because `Optional` is a final class and cannot be extended.
- **Reference method:** This is not a specific type of method in the context of the `Optional` class.

So, the best answers are **Static method** and **Concrete method**.

The `Optional` class in Java is a container object used to represent the presence or absence of a value. It was introduced in Java 8 as a way to reduce the likelihood of `NullPointerException`s and provide a more expressive means of dealing with null values.

### Key Concepts of `Optional`

1. **Creating an Optional:**
    
    - `Optional.empty()`: Creates an empty `Optional` instance, signifying no value is present.
    - `Optional.of(value)`: Creates an `Optional` with the given non-null value. If the value is null, it throws a `NullPointerException`.
    - `Optional.ofNullable(value)`: Creates an `Optional` that may hold a null value. If the value is null, it creates an empty `Optional`.
    
    **Example:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> emptyOpt = Optional.empty(); Optional<String> nonEmptyOpt = Optional.of("Hello, World!"); Optional<String> nullableOpt = Optional.ofNullable(null); // or Optional.ofNullable("Hello, World!");`
    
2. **Checking if a Value is Present:**
    
    - `isPresent()`: Returns `true` if the value is present; otherwise, `false`.
    - `ifPresent(Consumer)`: Executes the given `Consumer` if a value is present. Otherwise, does nothing.
    
    **Example:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> opt = Optional.of("Hello"); if (opt.isPresent()) {     System.out.println(opt.get()); // Prints "Hello" }  opt.ifPresent(value -> System.out.println(value)); // Prints "Hello"`
    
3. **Retrieving the Value:**
    
    - `get()`: Returns the value if present, otherwise throws `NoSuchElementException`.
    - `orElse(T other)`: Returns the value if present; otherwise, returns the provided default value.
    - `orElseGet(Supplier<T> other)`: Returns the value if present; otherwise, invokes the provided `Supplier` and returns the result.
    - `orElseThrow(Supplier<X> exceptionSupplier)`: Returns the value if present; otherwise, throws an exception provided by the `Supplier`.
    
    **Example:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> opt = Optional.ofNullable(null);  String value = opt.orElse("Default Value"); System.out.println(value); // Prints "Default Value"  String value2 = opt.orElseGet(() -> "Generated Default Value"); System.out.println(value2); // Prints "Generated Default Value"  try {     String value3 = opt.orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("No value present")); } catch (RuntimeException e) {     System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Prints "No value present" }`
    
4. **Transforming the Value:**
    
    - `map(Function)`: Applies a function to the value if present, and returns an `Optional` containing the result. If the value is absent, it returns an empty `Optional`.
    - `flatMap(Function)`: Similar to `map`, but the function itself returns an `Optional`, and `flatMap` flattens it to a single `Optional` result.
    
    **Example:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> opt = Optional.of("Hello"); Optional<Integer> lengthOpt = opt.map(String::length); System.out.println(lengthOpt.get()); // Prints "5"  Optional<String> nullOpt = Optional.ofNullable(null); Optional<Integer> lengthOpt2 = nullOpt.map(String::length); System.out.println(lengthOpt2.isPresent()); // Prints "false"`
    
5. **Filtering Values:**
    
    - `filter(Predicate)`: Returns an `Optional` containing the value if it matches the given predicate. If the value does not match, it returns an empty `Optional`.
    
    **Example:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> opt = Optional.of("Hello"); Optional<String> filteredOpt = opt.filter(s -> s.startsWith("H")); System.out.println(filteredOpt.isPresent()); // Prints "true"  Optional<String> emptyOpt = opt.filter(s -> s.startsWith("A")); System.out.println(emptyOpt.isPresent()); // Prints "false"`
    

### Practical Use Cases of `Optional`

1. **Avoiding Null Checks:** `Optional` can help avoid explicit null checks in your code, leading to cleaner and more expressive code.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public Optional<String> getUserNickname(String userId) {     User user = findUserById(userId);     return Optional.ofNullable(user.getNickname()); }`
    
2. **Chaining Operations:** `Optional` can be used to chain multiple operations safely without worrying about intermediate null values.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<User> user = findUserById(userId); String city = user.map(User::getAddress)                   .map(Address::getCity)                   .orElse("Unknown City");`
    
3. **Default Values:** Providing default values or handling cases where a value might not be present becomes straightforward with `Optional`.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `Optional<String> opt = findUserNickname(userId); String nickname = opt.orElse("Guest");`
    

### Summary

The `Optional` class in Java is a powerful tool for handling values that may or may not be present. It provides a more expressive and less error-prone way to handle nulls, leading to safer and cleaner code.

The correct methods of the `Stream` class that take objects of the `Comparator` interface and are used to find aggregates are:

1. **max()**
2. **min()**

**Explanation:**

- **`max()`**: This method is used to find the maximum element of the stream according to the provided `Comparator`. It returns an `Optional` containing the maximum element, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty.
    
- **`min()`**: This method is used to find the minimum element of the stream according to the provided `Comparator`. It returns an `Optional` containing the minimum element, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty.
    

The other options:

- **`mapToAvg()`**: This is not a standard method provided by the Stream API.
- **`stream()`**: This method is used to convert a collection into a stream and does not take a `Comparator` as an argument.

So, the best answers are **`max()`** and **`min()`**.

1. **AssertionError(long detailMessage)**
2. **AssertionError(int detailMessage)**
3. **AssertionError(String detailMessage)**
4. **AssertionError(Throwable detailMessage)**

**Explanation:**

The `AssertionError` class in Java provides multiple constructors that allow you to create an `AssertionError` object with different types of detail messages:

- **AssertionError(long detailMessage)**: Allows you to create an `AssertionError` with a `long` value as the detail message.
- **AssertionError(int detailMessage)**: Allows you to create an `AssertionError` with an `int` value as the detail message.
- **AssertionError(String detailMessage)**: Allows you to create an `AssertionError` with a `String` message.
- **AssertionError(Throwable detailMessage)**: Allows you to create an `AssertionError` with a `Throwable` as the detail message.

So, **all the options listed are valid constructors** for creating an `AssertionError` object.

The valid types of method references that can be used in Java are:

1. **Static**
2. **Constructor**

**Explanation:**

In Java, method references provide a way to refer to methods or constructors without having to invoke them. The following are the valid types of method references:

- **Static Method Reference**: Refers to a static method. The syntax is `ClassName::staticMethodName`.
    
    - Example: `Math::abs` refers to the static method `abs` in the `Math` class.
- **Constructor Reference**: Refers to a constructor. The syntax is `ClassName::new`.
    
    - Example: `ArrayList::new` refers to the constructor of the `ArrayList` class.

The other options:

- **Abstract**: Abstract methods cannot be directly referenced because they do not have an implementation.
- **Final**: While you can reference a method that is `final`, "final method reference" is not a distinct type of method reference in Java.

So, the best answers are **Static** and **Constructor**.

Question: What are some of the functional interfaces that we can use to manage Primitive & Binary variations? Instruction: Choose all options that best answer the question. IntFunction IntPredicate IntProducer IntCloneable

###### ChatGPT said:

![GPT](https://files.oaiusercontent.com/file-q2JgTtnJ4eJKXww6RPerPyLS?se=2124-05-16T12%3A42%3A15Z&sp=r&sv=2023-11-03&sr=b&rscc=max-age%3D1209600%2C%20immutable&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dgpt5.png&sig=VdYwp%2BbdWBQFbCpZKpkhC2toC3eI9hXl4TE88w5EAFE%3D)

The correct functional interfaces that can be used to manage primitive and binary variations are:

1. **IntFunction**
2. **IntPredicate**

**Explanation:**

In Java, functional interfaces are used to represent functions that operate on specific primitive types or binary variations. Here’s what each of the correct options does:

- **IntFunction**: This is a functional interface that represents a function that takes an `int` as an argument and produces a result. It is used for operations where the input is of type `int`.
    
- **IntPredicate**: This is a functional interface that represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) that takes an `int` as an argument. It is used for operations that need to evaluate a condition on an `int`.
    

The other options:

- **IntProducer**: This is not a standard functional interface in Java. The correct functional interface for producing an `int` value is `IntSupplier`.
- **IntCloneable**: This is not a functional interface in Java. `Cloneable` is an interface used to indicate that a class allows for cloning, but there is no primitive-specific variant like `IntCloneable`.

So, the best answers are **IntFunction** and **IntPredicate**.

- **Supplier**: This is a functional interface that represents a supplier of results. It does not take any arguments but returns a result. The method signature is `T get()`.
    
- **Consumer**: This is a functional interface that represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. The method signature is `void accept(T t)`.
    

The other options:

- **Module**: This is not an interface in the `java.util.function` package. `Module` is a class in the `java.lang` module system introduced in Java 9, not related to functional interfaces.
- **References**: This is not an interface in the `java.util.function` package.

So, the best answers are **Supplier** and **Consumer**.

The correct options that specify some of the essential characteristics of the `Function` interface are:

1. **The function interface takes a single parameter and returns a single value**
2. **The function interface represents a method or a function**

**Explanation:**

- **The function interface takes a single parameter and returns a single value**: This is the primary characteristic of the `Function` interface. It is a functional interface that represents a function that takes one argument and produces a result. The method signature is `R apply(T t)`.
    
- **The function interface represents a method or a function**: The `Function` interface is designed to represent a function or method that can be passed around as an object. It is a key part of functional programming in Java.
    

The other options:

- **The function interface represents functions that consume values without returning any value**: This is not accurate for the `Function` interface. The `Consumer` interface represents functions that consume values without returning any value.
    
- **The function interface can take multiple parameters and return multiple values**: This is not correct for the `Function` interface. The `Function` interface is limited to taking a single parameter and returning a single value. If multiple parameters or values are involved, other functional interfaces like `BiFunction` (for two parameters) or custom interfaces would be used.
    

So, the best answers are **The function interface takes a single parameter and returns a single value** and **The function interface represents a method or a function**.

The correct methods that can be used to find objects from streams are:

1. **findAny()**
2. **findFirst()**

**Explanation:**

- **findAny()**: This method returns an `Optional` describing some element of the stream, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty. It is useful when you don't care which element you retrieve, especially in parallel streams.
    
- **findFirst()**: This method returns an `Optional` describing the first element of the stream, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty. It is often used when the order of elements is important.
    

The other options:

- **findObject()**: This is not a standard method provided by the Stream API.
- **findData()**: This is also not a standard method provided by the Stream API.

So, the best answers are **findAny()** and **findFirst()**.

The correct approaches in Java that can be used to sort collections are:

1. **Using the method `compareTo()`**
2. **Using Lambda expressions**

**Explanation:**

- **Using the method `compareTo()`**: This method is part of the `Comparable` interface, which allows objects of a class to be compared with each other for sorting purposes. By implementing `compareTo()`, you can define the natural order of objects in a collection.
    
- **Using Lambda expressions**: Lambda expressions can be used to pass custom comparators to sorting methods, such as `Collections.sort()` or `List.sort()`. This approach allows for more flexible and concise sorting logic without the need to implement a full comparator class.
    

The other options:

- **Using the method `arrange()`**: There is no `arrange()` method in the Java API for sorting collections.
- **Using the method `sortBy()`**: There is no `sortBy()` method in the Java standard library for sorting collections. The correct method is `sort()`.

So, the best answers are **Using the method `compareTo()`** and **Using Lambda expressions**.

The correct methods that can be used to operate on a stream and transform it into another stream are:

1. **map()**
2. **flatMap()**

**Explanation:**

- **map()**: This method is used to transform each element of a stream into another object via a function. It produces a new stream of the transformed elements.
    
- **flatMap()**: This method is used to transform each element of a stream into a stream of other objects and then flatten the resulting streams into a single stream. It’s commonly used when each element can be mapped to multiple elements.
    

The other options:

- **reduce()**: This method is a terminal operation that reduces the elements of a stream to a single value using a binary operator. It does not transform the stream into another stream.
    
- **count()**: This is also a terminal operation that returns the count of elements in the stream. It does not produce another stream.
    

So, the best answers are **map()** and **flatMap()**.

The correct methods that can be used to match data from streams and take a predicate as an argument are:

1. **anyMatch()**
2. **allMatch()**

**Explanation:**

- **anyMatch()**: This method checks if any elements of the stream match the given predicate. It returns `true` if at least one element matches; otherwise, it returns `false`.
    
- **allMatch()**: This method checks if all elements of the stream match the given predicate. It returns `true` if all elements match; otherwise, it returns `false`.
    

The other options:

- **objectMatch()**: This is not a standard method in the Stream API.
- **noMatch()**: This is also not a standard method in the Stream API. The correct method for checking if no elements match a predicate is `noneMatch()`.

So, the best answers are **anyMatch()** and **allMatch()**.

The correct default methods provided in the `Predicate` interface in Java are:

1. **negate()**
2. **or()**

**Explanation:**

- **negate()**: This default method returns a predicate that represents the logical negation of the current predicate. It essentially inverts the result of the predicate.
    
- **or()**: This default method returns a predicate that represents the logical OR of the current predicate and another predicate. It returns `true` if either predicate is `true`.
    

The other options:

- **nor()**: There is no `nor()` method in the `Predicate` interface.
- **xor()**: There is no `xor()` method in the `Predicate` interface.

So, the best answers are **negate()** and **or()**.

The correct methods of the `Optional` class that depend on the presence or absence of contained values are:

1. **ifPresent()**
2. **orElse()**

**Explanation:**

- **ifPresent()**: This method executes the given `Consumer` if a value is present in the `Optional`. If the `Optional` is empty, nothing happens.
    
- **orElse()**: This method returns the value if present, otherwise it returns the provided default value.
    

The other options:

- **elsePresent()**: This is not a method in the `Optional` class.
- **notPresent()**: This is also not a method in the `Optional` class.

So, the best answers are **ifPresent()** and **orElse()**.

The correct statements that list the differences between Collections and Streams are:

1. **Collections are eagerly evaluated whereas streams are lazily evaluated**
2. **Collections are about data whereas streams are for performing computations on data**

**Explanation:**

- **Collections are eagerly evaluated whereas streams are lazily evaluated**: In collections, all elements are computed and stored in memory as soon as the collection is created or modified. In contrast, streams are lazily evaluated, meaning that elements are computed only when required, particularly during terminal operations.
    
- **Collections are about data whereas streams are for performing computations on data**: Collections are designed to store and manage data (e.g., lists, sets, maps). Streams, on the other hand, are primarily used for processing sequences of data, offering operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, without storing the actual data.
    

The other options:

- **Collections are lazily evaluated whereas streams are eagerly evaluated**: This is incorrect; it is the streams that are lazily evaluated, not collections.
- **Collections are for performing computations on data whereas streams are about data**: This is incorrect; collections are about storing data, and streams are for performing computations on that data.

So, the best answers are **Collections are eagerly evaluated whereas streams are lazily evaluated** and **Collections are about data whereas streams are for performing computations on data**.

The correct essential components of streams are:

1. **Source**
2. **Final operations** (also known as terminal operations)
3. **Intermediate operations**

**Explanation:**

- **Source**: This is the origin of the stream, such as a collection (e.g., List, Set), an array, or an I/O channel. The source provides the data that the stream will process.
    
- **Intermediate operations**: These operations transform a stream into another stream. Examples include `filter()`, `map()`, and `sorted()`. They are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
    
- **Final operations (terminal operations)**: These operations produce a result or a side-effect, such as `collect()`, `forEach()`, or `reduce()`. They trigger the evaluation of the stream and complete the stream processing.
    

The other option:

- **Destination**: This is not a standard component of streams in Java. Streams process data from a source through intermediate operations and complete with terminal operations, but there is no concept of a "destination" in the stream API.

So, the best answers are **Source**, **Final operations**, and **Intermediate operations**.

The correct statements that can be used to create a stream are:

1. **Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);**
2. **Stream<T> stream = list.stream();**

**Explanation:**

- **Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);**: This is a valid way to create a stream from a series of values using the `Stream.of()` method.
    
- **Stream<T> stream = list.stream();**: This is a valid way to create a stream from a collection, such as a `List`, by calling the `stream()` method on the collection.
    

The other options:

- **Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.create(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);**: There is no `Stream.create()` method in the Java Stream API, so this statement is invalid.
    
- **Stream<T> stream = list.buildStream();**: There is no `buildStream()` method in the Java collections or Stream API, so this statement is also invalid.
    

So, the best answers are **Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);** and **Stream<T> stream = list.stream();**.

The correct features that a dataset must possess in order to prevent interferences during the execution of stream pipelines are:

1. **Unmodifiable**
2. **Concurrent collections**

**Explanation:**

- **Unmodifiable**: When a dataset is unmodifiable, it means that the data cannot be changed during the execution of a stream pipeline. This immutability ensures that there are no unexpected modifications that could lead to inconsistencies or interferences during stream processing.
    
- **Concurrent collections**: Using concurrent collections (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`) allows safe modifications during stream processing, especially in parallel streams. These collections are designed to handle concurrent access without causing interference, making them suitable for use in stream pipelines.
    

The other options:

- **Able to utilize terminal operations**: While utilizing terminal operations is a necessary part of executing a stream pipeline, it doesn't directly relate to preventing interferences. This option is not specifically about preventing interferences during execution.
    
- **Non-parallel stream**: Non-parallel streams are less prone to interference because they process data sequentially. However, this option is not about the dataset itself but rather the stream's execution mode. It is generally better to use unmodifiable datasets or concurrent collections to prevent interference, even in parallel streams.
    

So, the best answers are **Unmodifiable** and **Concurrent collections**.

The correct arguments that can be used to implement the `StreamSupport` class, which describes a stream and controls whether it is a parallel stream, are:

1. **Iterator**
2. **Spliterator**
3. **Parallel**

**Explanation:**

- **Iterator**: You can use an `Iterator` to create a stream using the `StreamSupport` class, particularly when working with custom data structures.
    
- **Spliterator**: A `Spliterator` is an important argument for the `StreamSupport` class because it can be used to create both sequential and parallel streams. It provides a way to traverse and partition elements, making it useful for parallel processing.
    
- **Parallel**: This argument can be used to control whether the stream created by `StreamSupport` is parallel or sequential. The `StreamSupport.stream` method has a boolean parameter (`parallel`) that determines if the stream is parallel.
    

The other option:

- **Sequential**: While "sequential" is a concept used to describe non-parallel streams, it is not an argument for the `StreamSupport` class itself. Instead, the `parallel` argument (as a boolean) is used to indicate whether the stream should be parallel or sequential.

So, the best answers are **Iterator**, **Spliterator**, and **Parallel**.

The correct features of Streams in Java are:

1. **Provides results based on streamed methods**
2. **Returns results in the form of streams**
3. **Streams doesn't change original data structures**

**Explanation:**

- **Provides results based on streamed methods**: Streams allow you to perform operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing on a sequence of elements. The results you obtain are based on the methods you apply to the stream.
    
- **Returns results in the form of streams**: Intermediate operations on streams (like `filter`, `map`, etc.) return another stream, which allows for method chaining and further processing.
    
- **Streams doesn't change original data structures**: One of the key characteristics of streams is that they do not modify the original data structure. Instead, they produce new streams or results based on the operations performed.
    

The other option:

- **Streams change original data structures**: This is incorrect. Streams are designed to operate on the data without modifying the underlying data structures.

So, the best answers are **Provides results based on streamed methods**, **Returns results in the form of streams**, and **Streams doesn't change original data structures**.

- **parallel()**: This method is used to convert an existing sequential stream into a parallel stream. For example, you can call `stream.parallel()` to get a parallel stream.
    
- **parallelStream()**: This method is available on collection classes (like `List`, `Set`, etc.) and is used to directly create a parallel stream from the collection.
    

The other options:

- **getParallel()**: This is not a standard method in the Java Stream API.
- **buildParallelStream()**: This is also not a standard method in the Java Stream API.

The correct terminal methods of the `Stream` interface are:

1. **findAny()**
2. **anyMatch()**

**Explanation:**

- **findAny()**: This is a terminal operation that returns an `Optional` describing some element of the stream, or an empty `Optional` if the stream is empty.
    
- **anyMatch()**: This is a terminal operation that returns `true` if any elements of the stream match the provided predicate, or `false` otherwise.
    

The other options:

- **flatMap()**: This is not a terminal method; it is an intermediate operation used to transform each element of the stream into another stream and then flatten the resulting streams into a single stream.
    
- **distinct()**: This is also not a terminal method; it is an intermediate operation that returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to `Object.equals()`) of the stream.

The valid Stream statements that implement ordering or reduction operations on a list that stores `Employee` objects with an `age` attribute are:

1. **`list.stream().reduce((p1, p2) -> p1.age > p2.age ? p1 : p2)`**
    
    - **Explanation**: This statement performs a reduction operation on the stream of `Employee` objects. It uses the `reduce()` method to find the employee with the maximum age. This is a valid reduction operation.
2. **`list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("c")).map(String::toUpperCase).sorted()`**
    
    - **Explanation**: This statement first filters the stream for elements that start with "c", maps them to uppercase strings, and then sorts the resulting strings. This is a valid operation chain for filtering, mapping, and ordering a stream.

The other options:

- **`list.stream().reduce((p1, p2) -> p1.age > p2.age ? p1 : p2).filter(s -> s.startsWith("c"))`**: This is not valid because `filter()` is an intermediate operation that should be applied before the terminal operation `reduce()`. Once `reduce()` is called, you can't chain other stream operations like `filter()`.
    
- **`list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("c")).sorted(String::toUpperCase).map(String::toUpperCase)`**: This is not valid because `sorted()` requires a comparator or uses the natural ordering, but `String::toUpperCase` is not a valid comparator. Sorting should be done on comparable elements or with a proper comparator.
    

So, the best answers are **`list.stream().reduce((p1, p2) -> p1.age > p2.age ? p1 : p2)`** and **`list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("c")).map(String::toUpperCase).sorted()`**.
