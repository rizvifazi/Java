Certainly, here's a table outlining the differences between List, Set, Map, and Properties in Java:

### Compare

| Feature                    | List                                      | Set                                     | Map                                                   | Properties                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                   | Ordered collection of elements            | Unordered collection of unique elements | Collection of key-value pairs                         | Key-value store (based on a Hashtable)      |
| **Duplicates**             | Allowed                                   | Not allowed                             | Not allowed for keys (unique), allowed for values     | Not allowed                                 |
| **Order**                  | Maintains insertion order                 | Does not maintain insertion order       | Does not maintain insertion order                     | Does not maintain insertion order           |
| **Access**                 | Elements accessible by index (get(index)) | Elements not accessible by index        | Values accessible by key (get(key))                   | Values accessible by key (getProperty(key)) |
| **Null Values**            | Allows multiple null values               | Allows at most one null value           | Allows a single null key, allows multiple null values | Allows for null keys and values             |
| **Common Implementations** | ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector             | HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet         | HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap                       |                                             |

**Additional Points:**

- List is ideal for storing elements where order matters, like a shopping list.
- Set is useful for ensuring unique elements, like removing duplicates from a list.
- Map is perfect for associating keys with values, like a phonebook with names and numbers.
- Properties are similar to Maps but designed for handling configuration files and system properties. They can load/store key-value pairs from various sources like files.

I hope this table clarifies the distinctions between these Java collection types!
