1. The Chennai Super Kings were the most successful team in the IPL with a win percentage of 60.68 and had won the title twice in succession (2010 and 2011).

The CSKs have played “n” matches so far in IPLs. Given the number of matches “n” that CSK has played and their team score in the matches as a list, write a program to find the total runs and the average runs scored by the team in all “n” matches.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer “n” that corresponds to the number of matches played by CSK.
Next “n” lines contains an integer in each line, that corresponds to the runs scored by CSK in each of the “n” matches.

Output Format:
Output should print in the first line the integer that gives the total runs scored by CSK in the matches.
In the second line, print a float value that gives the average runs.

Sample Input :
5
200
210
180
176
192

Sample Output :
958
191.6


2.  A measure of a batsman's greatness is his ability to score runs on foreign conditions. It is quite obvious in Cricket that most batsmen have been excellent at home grounds but flops overseas. Consequently not many teams have aggregates balanced in terms of home and away performances.

Sunil now wanted to analyze the performance of IPL teams based on the runs scored in home as well away matches. Given are the team name, number of matches played by the team in home ground “n” and away grounds “m” respectively, runs scored by the team in each of the matches both home and away respectively. Write a program to store the runs scored by the team in both home ground and in other grounds in a list and help Sunil to display the score (in both home and away grounds) of the team that is greater than 300.

Input Format:

First line of the input contains a string that gives the name of the IPL team.

Second line of input contains the integer “n” that corresponds to the number of matches played by the team in home grounds.

Next “n” lines contains the runs scored by the team in each of the matches in home grounds.

Next line that follows contains the integer “m” that corresponds to the number of matches played by the team in away grounds.

Next “m” lines contains the runs scored by the team in each of the matches in away grounds.

Output Format:

Output should display the runs scored by the team in both home ground and in other grounds as a list, line after line.

In the lines to follow, the output should display the score (in both home and away grounds) of the team that is greater than 300, line after line.
